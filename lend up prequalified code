Before you consider using a loan from one of the many online direct payday loan lenders, you will want to make sure you give the whole borrowing process some thought. One of the biggest problems in short-term lending today is when a borrower doesn't plan for the payoff just a few short weeks later.

Affording a loan does not necessarily mean that you have the money for it. It is important to keep all of your other costs in mind prior to signing for the loan. In its efforts to help educate the public, the government created a 'quiz' to test your borrowing knowledge. It's a little questionnaire which makes you think about whether or not applying for a direct payday lender's loan is going to help you. In fact, this little quiz could help you with any type of loan. When your income struggles to afford everyday costs, adding the price of third party money often spells trouble.

Are you aware of how much of your monthly income pays the cost of interest for other types of loans or outstanding credit? If you are spending 20% of your income towards other debt (not including a home mortgage) than you are spending too much. There are many differences between credit card debt verses obtaining a loan from a payday direct lender. The difference between interest charges is in affordability.
